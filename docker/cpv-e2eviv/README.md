# Cryptographic Protocol Verification Docker Image

This folder contains everything needed to build and run the Free & Fair cryptographic protocol verification Docker image. The current image supports Tamarin-based CI/CV workflows and includes Tamarin together with the tools it relies on in practice, including Maude, Yices2, and Graphviz. It also includes [Kevin Milner's Rust port of Tamarin](https://github.com/kamilner/tamarin-rs), which we use in GitHub CI/CV because it is significantly faster and less memory-hungry than the canonical Tamarin, and ProVerif, which is currently only used by the pedagogical example. The binaries for these are `tamarin-prover`, `tamarin-rs`, and `proverif`, respectively.

Note that it is _far_ less efficient to run Tamarin within Docker than it is to run it natively on your hardware; Tamarin is aggressively multi-threaded and consumes large amounts of memory, so we _strongly_ recommend installing Tamarin locally instead of relying on this Docker image; the primary motivation for this image is to provide a uniform environment for running CI/CV (e.g., in GitHub actions). While the image does support both ARM64 and AMD64 platforms, it is still less efficient than running natively.

## Prerequisites

Building the image requires the following:

- make
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) or Docker-compatible tools, such as [Podman](https://podman.io/)

In order to use/run the Docker image from the [Free & Fair Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv) repository, the only prerequisite is Docker or a Docker-compatible tool for the host OS.

## Building the Docker Image

The build process is simplified via a _Makefile_. Typing `make` will show the build targets, which are self-explanatory; `make image` uses `IMAGE_PLATFORM` to determine what image platforms to build. By default, `make image` builds for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. To build only ARM64 (including on Apple Silicon Docker hosts), run:

`make IMAGE_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 image`

### Storage Requirements

A fresh multi-platform build of this image requires up to approximately 38GB of local Docker storage from a clean state. Actual usage will vary by host, Docker version, and cache state.

## Deploying the Docker Image

In order to deploy the Docker image, use `make push`. This command builds and publishes a single manifest image (`freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv:latest`) for the architectures listed in `IMAGE_PLATFORM` (default: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`). This command requires the user to log into [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) and to be a member of the [FreeAndFair](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/freeandfair) DockerHub organization with appropriate permissions to push into the [freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv) image repository. The build target performs that login automatically before pushing, but it can also be triggered manually via `make login` (to log in) and `make logout` (to log out).

## Executing the Docker Image

Two helper scripts are provided in [`scripts/`](./scripts):

- [`run-local.sh`](./scripts/run-local.sh): run a locally built image (`cpv-e2eviv`).
- [`run-remote.sh`](./scripts/run-remote.sh): pull and run the remote image (`freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv:latest`).

Both scripts map the current working directory to `/work` inside the image so files can be read and written directly from the host.

You can still run the image manually, for example:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(PWD):/work" -w "/work" freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv:latest
```

For `run-remote.sh`, Docker login is optional. If `DOCKER_READ_ONLY_TOKEN` and `DOCKER_READ_ONLY_TOKEN_USERNAME` are set, the script performs authenticated pull; otherwise it pulls anonymously.

Likewise, `make pull` is login-optional and uses the same token environment variables when provided.

## Vulnerabilities Reported by Docker Scout

Docker Scout results vary over time as upstream base images and package feeds change. For a current snapshot, run `docker scout quickview cpv-e2eviv:latest` or `docker scout quickview freeandfair/cpv-e2eviv:latest`.
