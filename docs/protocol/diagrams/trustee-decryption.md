# Election Key Generation Subprotocol Sequence Diagram

We list the Trustee Board as a separate protocol actor here, even though it is maintained by the Trustee Administration Server, to show what gets posted to the board and what information the Trustee Adminstration Server reads from the board at the end of the protocol (to add to the election configuration).
