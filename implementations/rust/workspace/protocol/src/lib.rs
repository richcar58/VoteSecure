//! The core library for the VoteSecure project.
//!
//! This library provides state machine implementations of the e-voting protocol
//! for all participants. It is designed to be integrated into host applications
//! that will provide the necessary networking and user interface layers.
//!
//! The primary entry point for each participant is a top-level actor, which
//! manages the state for all that participant's subprotocols.

// The nightly features below are needed only so that custom_warning_macro
// attributes can appear in statement/expression position. Gating them (and
// every such attribute use, via cfg_attr) behind the `custom-warnings`
// feature lets this crate compile on stable Rust by default; enabling
// `custom-warnings` requires a nightly toolchain, as before.
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "custom-warnings",
    feature(stmt_expr_attributes, proc_macro_hygiene)
)]

// --- Public Modules ---
// These modules contain the data structures that are passed to and from the actor.

// Disable unused imports warning as the cryptography utils are used by the VSerializable macro
// but clippy can't figure that out.
#[allow(unused_imports)]
