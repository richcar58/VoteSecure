# VoteSecure Change Log

This change log lists changes to VoteSecure with each released version. It is not comprehensive (i.e., it does not include non-material changes like fixes for typographical errors, updates to the continuous integration scripts, etc.).

## [Version 1.3](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/releases/tag/v1_3) - 15 May 2026

- added documentation (in the CONOPS and relevant protocol specifications) to clarify that trustee public keys are expected to be broadly publicly known so that trustee signatures are publicly verifiable, and that trustee signatures for the election public key should be posted to the public bulletin board
- renamed several Rust structures to increase understandability; this does not change any SDK functionality or protocol descriptions but does break the API, necessitating the 1.2 → 1.3 version bump
- added `rustdoc` comments to public structures/functions in the `protocol` crate that did not previously have them, and updated many existing `protocol` crate documentation comments; aside from fixing some minor issues with existing comments, documentation comments were not updated in the `cryptography` crate as application developers typically do not program directly against it

## [Version 1.2](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/releases/tag/v1_2) - 5 May 2026

- updated Rust `rand` package to 0.10.1 to address [RUSTSEC-2026-0097](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0097)
- updated ballot submission protocol documentation to match implementation details
- fixed a formatting error in the CONOPS
- fixed comment syntax issues in the Mermaid diagrams for the cryptographic protocols

## [Version 1.1.1](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/releases/tag/v1_1_1) - 10 April 2026

- updated threat model and procedures to address security advisories [GHSA-v43c-fm6q-w8f8](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/security/advisories/GHSA-v43c-fm6q-w8f8) and [GHSA-w7jj-jfcc-gf89](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/security/advisories/GHSA-w7jj-jfcc-gf89)
- removed the Cryptol compiler and all references thereto, as we were not actually using it to generate code
- fixed a minor type inference issue that prevented the Cryptol model from working with current versions of Cryptol
- added continuous integration for the Isabelle E2E-VIV session
- reimplemented the browsable view of the threat model as a completely local HTML/JavaScript document with additional views, cross-linking, and many other quality-of-life enhancements; this is now part of each release, in addition to the PDF version of the threat model ([direct download link](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/releases/download/latest/threat-model.html))
- reimplemented CI/CD/CV orchestration across the repository
- updated Tamarin proof scripts to support a minor change necessitated by Tamarin 1.12's modified handling of functions declared by builtins
- fixed various spelling and typographical errors in the repository

## [Version 1.1](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/releases/tag/v1_1) - 6 February 2026

- implemented mitigations for [a reported clash attack](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/6), which was originally reported as a security advisory; the implemented mitigations are described in the issue
- updated the protocol descriptions and diagrams to include the implemented mitigations
- updated the threat model to include the reported clash attack and its mitigations, and did some additional threat model cleanup
- implemented a missing check for a matching ballot tracker within the voting application's check procedure
- modified cryptographic context function names and usage for clarity
- reimplemented the threat model in Python and provided an additional graph visualization for it
